                            Corn flour is a versatile ingredient that provides numerous dietary benefits. It's a source of complex carbohydrates that provide sustained energy, making it ideal for maintaining stable blood glucose levels. Additionally, being gluten-free, it's suitable for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. Rich in fiber, it promotes digestive health and contributes to a feeling of fullness. Its content of B-complex vitamins and minerals such as iron and magnesium make it a nutritionally dense option for strengthening the nervous system and metabolism. With its culinary versatility, from preparing traditional dishes to making desserts, corn flour is a fundamental ingredient for a balanced and varied diet.

                            Semolina is a wheat-derived product, characterized by its coarser grind than conventional flour. It's produced from wheat grains stripped of their husk and comes in the form of granular powder, with a white color if it comes from soft wheat or yellowish if it's from hard wheat. It comes in different thicknesses, from the finest semolina to coarse semolina. It's used in various cuisines around the world to make a wide variety of dishes, such as pasta in Italy, porridge in England, couscous in North Africa, and crispy coatings. Its culinary versatility and nutritional value make it a cherished ingredient in many culinary cultures.

                            Soy flour is a versatile and nutritious product obtained by finely grinding defatted soybeans. It's an excellent source of high-quality plant proteins, dietary fiber, and a wide range of vitamins and minerals, including iron, calcium, and magnesium. Additionally, it's naturally gluten-free, making it suitable for individuals with gluten sensitivity or celiac disease. It's used in a variety of forms in cooking, as a substitute for wheat flour in baked goods, in smoothies, soups, and sauces to increase their nutritional value, and as a thickener in the food industry. Its versatility and nutritional profile make it a popular choice in vegetarian and vegan diets.
